<h3>Description...</h3>
<p>Eggy bread, pain perdu or French toast, this classic breakfast dish has plenty of names and just as many options for toppings. We like it with fresh berries</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>80ml whole milk</li>
    <li>40ml double cream</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Â½ tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>4 thick slices brioche</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>icing sugar and fresh berries, to serve (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Lay the brioche slices in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour the egg mixture over them. Allow to soak for 2-3 mins, then carefully turn over and soak for 2 mins more.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until foaming. Carefully lift 2 slices of the soaked brioche out of the dish and add to the frying pan. Fry for 3 mins on each side, until golden and crisp, then place on a wire rack over a baking tray in a warm oven while you repeat with the remaining slices.</li>
    <li>Serve dusted in icing sugar and scattered with fresh berries, if you like.</li>
